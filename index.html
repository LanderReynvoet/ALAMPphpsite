            <p>
                Let's start at the beginning you have installed Debian which was needed to set up your webserver.
            </p>
        </arrticl>
        <arrticl>
            <h2>Script</h2>
            <p>
                Afterwards you've made a directory and navigated to it using the <b>mkdir</b> and <b>cd</b> commands. This is not all you did on this part. You've also installed version control in the form of git using <b>apt install git</b> the apt install command can be used for installing many more packages! At the end you learned how to clone/download something from git using the <b>git clone</b> command.

            <h2>Site</h2>
            <p>
                Next you have learned how to open the site you just made using the script. You now know you need to command <b>ip a </b> to get your ip address on which your server is running. Afterwards you learned that its possible to browse to this ip address using the https:// prefix
